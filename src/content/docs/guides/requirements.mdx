### [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
   - Download the standalone installer (Choose the version that matches your system)
      - During Git installation - Adjust your PATH environment. Pick "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software".


### [Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)
   - Download the installer and follow the steps to set it up.


### [Visual Studio Community 2022 IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
   - Download the "Community" version.
   - You will also need to install the C++ compiler, this is done while installing VS.
      - Go to **Workloads** -> **Desktop & Mobile**

### [MySQL Server Community Edition](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/8.4.html)
   - Download the Windows MSI Installer.
   - You will be asked to login or signup, you can scroll down to the bottom and click "No thanks, just start my download".
   - When the installation is almost done, make sure "Launch the MySQL Instance Configuration Wizard" is checked, then click "Finish".
   - When the MySQL Instance Configuration Wizard launches, most default options are fine, but remember the username and password you use (root // whatever). You will need them to log into your chosen database management tool (below) in order to import SQL files later.
   - To test if MySQL is set up correctly, hit CTRL+ALT+DEL on your keyboard, enter the Task Manager, and select the "Services" tab. In the list of services you should see "MySQL" with a status of "Running".
   - Add MySQL to Environment Variables.
      - Go to Control Panel -> System
      - Go to Advanced System Settings
      - Go to Environment Variables
      - Under "Systemvariables" select **Path**
      - Edit and add your install path of MySQL, i.e **C:/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/bin/**
   - Make sure to find the MySQL development files; you'll need them later. These files are shipped with MySQL Server, search for them in the program files directory, MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\lib / MySQL\MySQL Server 8.4\lib.




### [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/download.php)
   - After the install, open HeidiSQL, and you will see a window like this.

   - Now click on the the **"New"** button.
   - Next, enter your MySQL login details that you used when you did step 4.
      - Before clicking on the **"Open"**, remember to click on **"Save"**, to save the details for the login.
   - If you fail to connect to your MySQL database, make sure its running inside the **services** tab on Windows, if you are not sure where to do this, head to the **troubleshooting** section of the install guide!


### [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
   - Download and install the Latest Release windows-x86_64.msi file, NEVER the RC (Release Candidate) versions.
   - We recommend compiling in 64-bit mode.

### [OpenSSL](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
   - Find the 64-bit version by finding the latest 3.x.x Win64 OpenSSL that is NOT the "light" version. (Example: Win64 OpenSSL v3.0.7)
   :::danger[Important!]
      **Note:** If you get the error 'Missing Microsoft Visual C++ .... Redistributable' while installing OpenSSL, [download the Microsoft Visual C++ 2017/2019/2022 Redistributable Package (x64) (Direct Download) (1.7MB Installer)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) and install it.
      
      **Note:** While installing OpenSSL, choose The OpenSSL binaries (/bin) directory (NOT "The Windows system directory") when given the choice of where to copy the OpenSSL DLLs. These DLLs will need to be located easily for [Core Installation]().
   :::

### [Boost](https://www.boost.org)
   - Download the prebuilt Windows Binary for Visual Studio 2022. [64bit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.81.0/boost_1_81_0-msvc-14.3-64.exe/download)
   - Add an environment variable to the "System" variable named "BOOST_ROOT" and with the value being your Boost installation directory, e.g. C:/local/boost_1_81_0. Important is to use '/', not '\' when pointing to the directory. (Make sure that it does not have a trailing slash (end of the path). If you still get problems, add the same variable in the USER variables section too, as shown in the image below.).

   **Note:** Notice that this image shows the version number 1.81.0 - use your actual version number in your settings..
