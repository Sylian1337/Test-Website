## Pulling & Compiling the source
---

### Pulling the code
   1. Create the directory where the source files will be located. In this guide, we will use **C:\SylCore**.
   2. Open up Github Desktop
   3. Click **File** -> **Clone repository**... in the top left
   4. Click **URL**
   5. Fill in the data as follow:
   ```
   Repository URL or GitHub username and repository: https://github.com/SylCore/SylCore-WoTLK
   Local path: C:\SylCore
   ```
   6. Click **Clone**. Within a few minutes, SylCore's source files will be cloned into **C:\SylCore**.

### Configuring and generating Visual C++ solution with CMake
   :::caution[Important!]
   Before you begin, create a new directory called **Build**. In this guide, we will use **C:\Build**.
   :::
   1. Open **CMake**
   2. Click **Browse Source**... → Select the source directory (**C:\SylCore**)
   3. Click **Browse Build**... → Select the build directory (**C:\Build**)
   4. Click **Configure**.
   5. In the dropdown menu, choose the version of the compiler you downloaded in the [Requirements](/guides/requirements) section. Be sure to choose the **Win64** version if you work on a 64-bit compilation.
   6. Make sure that **Use default native compilers** is checked.
   7. Click **Finish**.
   8. Make sure **TOOLS_BUILD** is set to all. This will compile the extractors needed later in the setup.
   9. Click **Configure** again. As long as you have error(s) typed in red in the log window you will need to check your parameters and re-run it.
   10. Click **Generate**. This will install the selected build files into your **C:\Build** folder.
   :::danger[NOTE]
   If you encounter any errors in CMake, see the [Common Errors](Add Link Here).

### Compiling the Source
   1. In CMake press **Open Project** to open the **SylCore.sln** file directly with Visual Studio.
   2. In the menu at the top, click **Build** and select **Configuration Manager**.
      - Set Active Solution Configuration to **RelWithDebInfo**.
      - Set **Active Solution Platform** to **x64** and then click Close (settings automatically save).
   3. Right-click **ALL_BUILD** in the Solution Explorer on the right sidebar and select **Clean**.
   4. Right-click **ALL_BUILD** and select **Build**. (Ctrl + Shift + B)
      - If your GUI does not show Solution Explorer, click the Build menu and select **Clean Solution**, and then **Build**.
   
   :::caution[Important]
   Build time differs from machine to machine, but you can expect it to take between 5 and 30 minutes.

   If you are asked to "Reload build files" during or after the compilation, do so.
   :::
   
   When the build is complete you will find a message in the output that looks similar to this:
```plaintext
========== Build: 22 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 1 skipped ==========
```

### Moving the DLL files
You will find your freshly compiled binaries in the **C:\Build\bin\RelWithDebInfo** or **C:\Build\bin\Debug** folder. These are all used to run your server at the end of this instruction.

You will need the following files in order for the core to function properly:
   
   When the build is complete you will find a message in the output that looks similar to this:
```plaintext
\configs\
authserver.exe
authserver.pbd
worldserver.exe
worldserver.pdb
libmysql.dll
legacy.dll
libcrypto-3-x64.dll
libssl-3-x64.dll
```
There are four DLL files that need to be manually added to this folder, and you need to copy them from the following directories:
:::caution[DLL Locations]
   **libmysql.dll** → `C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.X\lib`

   **legacy.dll**, **libcrypto-3-x64.dll** and **libssl-3-x64.dll** → `C:\OpenSSL-Win64\bin`
:::

In the **configs** folder you should find:
```plaintext
authserver.conf.dist
worldserver.conf.dist
gameplay.conf.dist
```
