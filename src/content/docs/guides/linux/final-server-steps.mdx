### Initialize Servers
Initialize the auth and world servers for the first time:

```bash
# Navigate to the bin directory
cd ~/SylCore/bin

# Start the authserver
# Wait until you see "Authserver initialized successfully. Ready for connections!" message
# Then press Ctrl+C to stop it
./authserver

# Start the worldserver
# Wait until you see "World initialized" message
# Then press Ctrl+C to stop it
./worldserver

# Return to the home directory
cd ~/
```
---

### Configure Server IP
Set up your server IP for client connections:

```bash
# Show current IP setting
sudo mysql -e "SELECT address FROM acore_auth.realmlist WHERE id = 1\G"

# Update the IP address (replace 192.168.1.100 with your actual server IP)
sudo mysql -e "UPDATE acore_auth.realmlist SET address = '192.168.1.100' WHERE id = 1;" acore_auth

# Verify the change
sudo mysql -e "SELECT address FROM acore_auth.realmlist WHERE id = 1\G"
```
---

### First Start
Starting the servers:

```bash
# Navigate to the bin directory
cd ~/SylCore/bin

# Start the authserver in a detached tmux session
tmux new-session -d -s authserver './authserver'

# Start the worldserver in a detached tmux session
tmux new-session -d -s worldserver './worldserver'

# Check that the authserver and worldserver session is running
tmux ls

# Open tmux sessions
tmux session-attach -t authserver
tmux session-attach -t worldserver
```
