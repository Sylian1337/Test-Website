title: Final Server Steps
description: Get started with SylCore WoTLK Server

---

### Starting the server
Run authserver and worldserver in your build folder.

:::caution
NEVER create an account directly into your database unless you are **ABSOLUTELY SURE** that you know what to do and how to do it!
:::

   1. Next, create your Login Account by typing directly into the worldserver window the GM Command account create. Syntax: (see examples below)
   2. If you wish to set the account as a GM then type into the worldserver window:
   :::tip[Create GM Account Command]
   **account set gmlevel $account #level #realmid**
   :::
    where **$account** is the account name to change, **#level** can be 0-4 and #realmid is the realm ID. Setting a **#level** of "3" is GM account level (higher numbers = more access), and the "-1" is the realm ID that stands for "all realms".

:::tip[Create GM Account Command]
   Open your **acore_world** database and find the **command** table. This shows a full list of GM Commands, descriptions, and security levels.
This will always be the most up-to-date list you can find, assuming you keep your DB and Core updated.
:::

   3. Minimize your servers and run **WoW** (never run WoW using the Launcher unless you edited the realmlist.wtf's patchlist option above).
   4. Log in using the user/pass you just created.
   5. The SylCore realm should be selectable. Log in, create a character, and you're all done!
